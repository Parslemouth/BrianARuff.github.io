  <h1>Section One: Introduction</h1><hr />
  <h2>Intro to Ruby on Rails (RoR)</h2>
    <p>
      - Ruby is made up of two parts. <span
      class="font-full-decoration">Ruby and Rails</span>
      - Rails is an object oriented programming language
      - Rails is an open source framework written in the Ruby programming
        language.
      - A framework is a set of code libraries and data-structures that
        provide generic functionality that can be used,
        overridden or edited.
      - Rails is one of the most popular frameworks in the world.
    </p>
  <h2>Why Use Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p>
      - The Ruby language is Object oriented, easily readable,
        unsurprising syntax and behavior.
      - Ruby on Rails runs on the principle of DRY code (don't repeat
        yourself) which means that every fundamental piece of info. should
        be expressed in just one place.
      - RoR was built to be concise and is easily maintainable.
      - Another Ruby principle is convention over configuration which is
        sensible default options which means only the unconventional aspects need to be defined. This speeds up development and leads to less
        code to maintain. RoR uses the 'best practices' that are currently on the Web.
    </p>
  <h3>Who should Use RoR?</h3>
    <p>
      - Any cane use it, but developers with previous experience, those who
        want to build sites that interact with databases, those who
        are tired of recreating site functionality from scratch, those who
        like best practices, and for developers who are not afraid of the
        command line.
    </p>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      - Have web basics already down (browsers, servers, and
        pages.)
      - HTML
      - SQL
      - CSS & Javascript
      - Ruby!!
    </p>
  <h2>Understanding MVC Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      M - Model: data objects, data is most common type of object.
      V - View: psentation layer (HTML, CSS, JS), what the user sees.
      C - Controllers: process and responds to user requests (clicking
      on links). It controls interaction between model and view.

  <!-- Section Two -->
  <h1>Section Two: Installation</h1><hr />
  <h2>Finding Terminal</h2>
    <p>
      1. File>New Finder>Applications>Utilities>Terminal(drag to doc). If on
      windows download GitBash.
    </p>
  <h3>Linux/Mac Commands</h3>
  <p>
    -  cd ==> change directories
    -  ~ ==> home director
    -  ls ==> listing of current directory contents
    -  cd .. ==> moves back a directory
    -  -  ==> the dash(-) lets shell know options are being
                          pass through. The dash must be attached to
                          another command.
    -  ls -la ==> lists all items of directory, file permissions,
                        file owner, file size, date, and shows hidden files.
    -  cmd+k ==> clears shell screen
    -  clear ==> clears shell screen
    -  echo ==> return a value to shell
    -  echo $SHELL ==> gives value of constant called SHELL
    -  which echo ==> shows location of shell
    -  echo $PATH ==> places it will look for commands and the
                      order it will look for them
    -  nano filename ==> opens terminal text editor
    -  cat filename ==> shows the contents of a file
  </p>
  <h3>Windows Commands</h3>
  <p>
    - dir ==> show contents of current directory. The equivalent of ls
    - tab ==> auto completes files/folder names
    - ../ ==> goes back a directory
    - cd name/name/ ==> goes forward more than one directory
  </p>
  <h3>Console Tricks</h3>
    <p>
    -  cd folder/folder/folder ==> You can change directory to
                                   more than one folder at a time.

    -  tab completion ==> Enter the first few letters of a
                          folder/file and then pss tab to
                          auto-complete the name.

    -  cd ../ ==> moves back a specified amount of
                  directories (is specified by the number of
                  ../ following the cd command.)
    </p>
    <h2>Installing Ruby</h2>
    <p>
      1. Go to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby webpage</a> and
         and look for the current stable version.
      2. Download and install <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org">ruby
         installer</a>, and be sure to install the appropriate version
         for your operat ing system (32bit/64bit), and follow the install
         instructions, and be sure to check the checkbox for "Add Ruby
         executable files with Ruby installation" as well as the checkbox
         for "Associate .rb and .rbw with the Ruby installation."
      3. Check version in power shell to verify installation.
      4. Note that for this guide we'll be installing version 2.0
         <pre>
           PS C:\> ruby -v
           ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16) [x64-mingw32]
         </pre>
         <p>
           If no version comes up then try restarting the computer and
           rerunning the command.
         </p>
         <p>
           Another way to test if it's installed is this:
         </p>
         <pre>
           PS C:\>  ruby -e "puts 1+1"
           2
         </pre>
         <p>
           This is executing the ruby code "puts 1+1 "
         </p>
         <p>
           A third way verify installation is with irb.
         </p>
         <pre>
           PS C:\> irb
           irb(main):001:0> 2+2
           => 4
         </pre>
         <p>
           "irb" runs the program called <span>interactive ruby</span>
           which is similar to a shell for the ruby programming language.
         </p>
         <p>
           4. Install <a href="http:www.rubyinstaller.org/downloads">Development
               Kit</a>, and scroll down the page to get the development
               kit that matches the version of Ruby that you have
               installed, and follow the installation prompts. When
               extracting this program be sure to extract it in a new
               folder called "DevKit", so the file path will be
               "C:\DevKit". We are using the kit for 2.0 to 2.3<br />
               <img src="devkit.png" class="pic-styles" /><br />
               Then do the following lines of code
         </p>
         <pre>

    PS C:\DevKit> ls
      Directory: C:\DevKit

    <h3>Ruby Gems</h3>
    <p>
      Ruby gems are typically installed with the Ruby installer.
      However, you can do so manually by going to the <a
      href="http://www.rubygems.org">Ruby gems</a>
      webpage, and installing the most recent version.

    <p>
      Since we are using an older version of ruby we may
      have to install the gem certifier manaully. We can
      do this by following the steps <a
      href="http://guides.rubygems.org/ssl-certificate-upd
      ate/#installing-using-update-packages">here</a>
    </p>
    <p id="three">
      You may have to install an older version of MySQL
      to get up-and-running as well. Go to your current
      gemfile for this project and delete the current
      mysql version and paste in <span># Use mysql as the
      database for Active Record
      gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.20'</span>, and then run
      <span>bundle install</span> in the command line.
      Next, go to the <span>Config>database.yml</span>
      file and enter your MySQL root password.

      <h1>Section 3: Create Project</h1><br />
      <h2>Create Project Directory</h2>
      <p>
        Since we are using the WEBBRICK webserver that
        comes with rails we can access our app from
        anywhere on our hard drive. However, it still
        makes since to keep it with your other web code.
      </p>
      <h3>Creating a Work Web Directory</h3>

        2. cd to your C drive <span>C:\</span>

      <h3>Create App Framework</h3>
      <p>
        generate the app framework by typing in <span>rails new app_name -d
        mysql</span>. You want to name your apps using the CamelCasing
        naming convention or by seperating each word with underscores. This
        command is essentially saying "create a new app using the rails
        framework that is configured to use the mysql database." If you do
        not type in -d mysql then rails will default to sqllite3. Rails can
        support sqlite3, mysql, and postgresql. Rails has database support
        via plugins from oracle, ibm_db, sqlserver, and frontbase in the
        form of rubygems.

          bundler. They are called <span>Gemfile and Gemfile.lock</span>. In
          your command line type in <span>atom gemfile</span>. This will
          prompt our text editor to open the Gemfile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemfile contails configuration information about what gemfiles we
          want to load as well as their corresponding versions. Gemfile is
          the file that we should edit when we want to add or remove gems
          from our project. Once you add or remove a gem, you must go to the
          command line and type in <span>bundle install</span>. This will
          push the changes the Gemfile.lock file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gemfile.lock lists the Gem followed by it's dependencies. Navigate
          to the Gemfile.lock and peruse through the file, but do not change
          this file. This is bundler file to modify, and it does so with the
          <span>bundle install</span> command.

             If you ever work on someone elses project then you should run
             bundle install, so that all the gems and depenedcies are sorted
             out and the application can be ran.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go through the Gemfile and comment out all the gems with the
            exception of <span>rails and mysql</span>. You can comment
            something out in Ruby by using the # symbol in front of the text
            you are targeting. When you comment something out it will turn a
            different color depending on your text editors color theme
            profile.

          <h2>Generating a Controller</h2>
          <p>
            We are going to generate a controller in this
            section,but to understand what is going on we
            need to think back to the MVC architecture.
          </p>
          <img src="mvc.png" alt="diagram of mvc process" class="pic-styles"/>
          <p>
            First, the browser makes a request which is
            received by the controller. The controller
            decides where the request should go. If the
            model is not needed then the controller goes
            to the views folder then back to the browser.
            The Browser-Controller-View-Browser triangle
            is the minimum requirement when a request
            occurs. This is the section that this
            section of this guide will focus on. We
            will go into more detail on the other
            parts later in the guide.
          </p>
          <h2>Create Controller and View</h2>
          <p>
            1. Ensure you are in the root of the rails application in the command line.
            2. type in <span>rails generate</span><br />
            <pre>
          PS C:\users\brff1\sites\app_name> rails generate controller demo index
          DL is deprecated, please use Fiddle
          create  app/controllers/demo_controller.rb
           route  get "demo/index"
          invoke  erb

          create    app/views/demo/index.html.erb

          create      app/assets/stylesheets/demo.css.scss
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            What did we just do? We
            created a controller named
            <span>demo</span>
            and a view called <span>index</span>. Why
            did I call the view
            index instead of
            view_name? Well, in truth, it
            could be called anything, so I
            am just using placeholder
            names in this guide.
            Furthermore, the term action
            and view are interchangable in
            the context of this guide and
            with ruby in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I call the view the
            action is because it the view
            is performing an action within
            the controller. Go to the
            follow file path in the atom
            text editor: <span>app_name>controllers>demo_controller.rb</span><br />
            <img src="viewname.png" class="pic-styles" /><br />
            The circled part is the view/action
            that we created. This view/action is
            associated with the demo
            controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we go to <span>app_name>app>views>demo>index.h
            tml.erb</span> we can access the
            html and ruby page that will be
            displayed on the webpage. What's
            important to note is the file
            pathing. The views has the demo
            folder with the index view file
            that we created when we generated
            the controller with the "rails
            generate controller demo
            <span class="font-full-decoration">index</span>" command.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, open up the
            <span>index.html.erb</span> file.
            Change the paragraph tag information
            so that it looks like
            &lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;

            This will make a change to the
            demo index views page. In order to
            access this file we must make some
            changes to the routes file. To do
            that go to
            <span>app_name>config>routes.rb
            </span> You will find:<br />
            <img src="routes_one.png" class="pic-styles" />
          </p>
            <p>
              The lines that say <span>get
              "demo/index"</span> is what allows
              allows our application to make the
              connection between the request
              that comes in and to know to send
              the request to the controller
              followed by the view
              ("demo/index").
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's access our new page by
              typing starting our rails server
              with <span>rails s</span> and then
              typing in
              <span>http://localhost:3000/demo/index</span> into your browser.
              You should get the pic below.<br />
            <img src="demoindex.png" class="pic-styles" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are getting errors that say
              you are missing jquery or
              turbolink then you need to
              uncomment those gems in the
              Gemfile and then run <span>bundle
              install</span> in the command
              line, run <span>rails s</span> and
              you should be able to view the
              page.
            </p>
            <h2>Rails File Structure</h2>
            <h3>App Directory</h3>
            <p>
              - Contains most of the
              applications code.
              - Contains the MVC strucutre, that
              is it houses the models, views and
              controllers folders.
              - The models folder contails a
              concerns folder which allows
              common code to be stored and
              shared to different controllers
              and models.
              - Helpers folder contains code
              that 'helps us' with our views.
              Any ruby code that supports the
              HTML views file is stored in the
              helpers folder.
              - Mailers folder is for sending
              emails.
              - Assets folder is the place for
              images, javascript and style
              sheets. It allows images/js/css to
              be used by the assets pipeline.
              - The bin folder hold  the bundle,
              rails and rake folder.
              - Config folder contains config
              files which is kept seperate from
              application code. It hold the
              database.yml and routes.rb files.
              It also houses the environment
              folder which contains the
              development, production and
              test.rb files which are used for
              various stages of development a
              website. The initializers folder
              holds files that are used when the
              app launches. The locales folder
              is for internationlization and
              shouldn't be messed with.
              - The db folder is for storing
              code related to managing our
              database (specfically db
              migrations.)
              -Gemfile and Gemfile.lock contain
              data pertaining gems and their
              dependencies, and works closely
              with bundler.
              - log folder is for logging info
              to log files.
              - public folder - anything in this
              is visible to the public.
              - README.rdoc is for explaining
              what your app does.
              - test folder - is a place for
              storing test code that is used for
              testing your app. Testing your app
              is a best practice in web
              development, and Rails has it
              built in.
              -vendor is rarely used due to ruby
              gems overtaking it's job, but it's
              used for third party code when
              necessary.
            </p>
            <h2>Handling Server Requests</h2>
            <img src="railsarch.png" class="pic-styles" /><br />
            <p>
              Above is the rails architecture, not
              just the MVC architecture. You see,
              before the MVC is accessed the webserver
              (WEBBRICK in our case) accesses the
              public folder and checks to see if the
              url matches any content within it. If
              the content does not match then it pases
              the request to the routes which then
              checks for the path, and sends the
              routing information (if there is a
              match) and it's sent off to the
              controller. The controller uses the
              routing data to decide if it needs to
              query the model or the views folders. If
              the model is not needed then the view is
              accessed, and then sent back to the
              webserver which sends the data to the
              users browser to be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are going to create a new html file
              in the public folder. The html file will
              contain the following code.
              <pre>
                &lt;p&gt;This is a test&lt;/p&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>
                We will then access the file through
                our server by typing in
                <span>localhost:3000/test.html</span><br />
                <img src="testpage.png" class="pic-styles" /><br />
                is the result your should get.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>

              Next, we are going to make a folder
              within the public folder and name the
              folder demo. Within the demo folder we
              are going to move the test.html file we
              made earlier.

              If you type in
              <span>localhost:3000/demo/test</span>
              then you will get the test.hml page
              still.

              But what happens if we change the name
              of test.html to index.html?

              We will have two files with partially
              the same name. The file in
              <span>views>demo>index.html.erb</span>
              and <span>public>demo>test.html</span>.
              However, since we have a
              <span>test.html</span> in the public
              folder it will be accessed first before
              the views folder because the rails
              artchitecture goes through the public
              folder before accessing the MVC
              architecture. Refer to the image
              below.<br />
              <img src="railsarch.png" class="pic-styles" id=four />
            </p>
        <h1>Section Four: Routes</h1><br />
        <h2>Simple, match route</h2>
        <p>
          For this part you will need to start by
          renaming the
          <span>Public>demo>index.html</span> back to
          test.html. The reason is that we want to
          access the MVC framework, not the public
          folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Type in <span>localhost:3000/demo</span> You
          will get an error that says <span>No route
            matches [GET] "/demo"</span>. Just make a
          mental note of this for now, and pull your
          webserver command line up, and look at the
          following line of text from the web server.
        </p>
        <pre>
          Started GET "/demo/index" for 127.0.0.1 at
          2017-10-09 19:36:16 -0400
          Processing by DemoController#index as HTML
            Rendered demo/index.html.erb within
            layouts/application (0.0ms)
          Completed 200 OK in 7ms (Views: 6.9ms |
          ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
        </pre>
        <p>
          The first line is saying the request was
          sent in to GET "/demo/index". This was then
          processed via DemoController#index that we
          made when we generated the controller and
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>get "demo/index"</span> is short for
          <span>match "demo/index",
            :to => "demo#index",
            :via => :get</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The longer bit of code above is saying
          "match the string "demo/index" to the
          controller "demo#index" via a :get request.
        </p>
        <h2>Default route structure</h2>
        <p>
          Defauly routes looks like
          <span>:controller/:action/:id </span> always
          in that order.
        </p>
        <p>
          The route <span>match
            ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))',
            :via => :get</span> is saying look for a
          controller as to what was typed in. In our
          case it was demo. Demo was found, so the
          page can be displayed with just typing
          <span>localhost:3000/demo</span>. Next, the
          page will look for actions followed by id
          and format. If the action is missing then
          then rails will look for a default action
          which in our case it is index since that's
          what we made when we created the controller
          with the <span>rails generate controller
            demo index</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Root Route</h2>
        <p>
          When you access the root of the page, but there is
          no text or action to match then where should you
          go? You simply make a root route that tells the app
          to
          go to the root of the app which is the home page.
          You can do this using <span>root :to =>
          "demo#index"</span> or the shorter version
          <span>root
         "demo#index"</span>. We place this route at the very
         top of the routes, and the match route we had
         earlier is placed at the bottom of all the routes.
