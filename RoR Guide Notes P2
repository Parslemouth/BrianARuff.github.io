Dynamic Content</h1><br />
<h2>Rendering Templates</h2>
<p>
  To begin, go to <span>app>views>demo</span> and
  make a duplicate copy of the
  <span>hello.html.erb</span> file. Once you have
  made the duplicate rename it to
  <span>hello.html.erb</span>
</p>
<p>
  Next, open the <span>index.html.erb</span> file up,
  and make it look like the code below.
</p>
<pre class="code">

  &lt;h1&gt;demo#index&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This page represents the demo controllers
  and the index action/view.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Now open up the <span>hello.html.erb</span> file and make it look like the code below.
</p>
<pre class="code">

  &lt;h1&gt;demo#hello&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This page represents the demo controller
  and the hello index/action.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Access <span>localhost:3000/demo/index and
  localhost:3000/demo/hello</span>. You should get
  both pages to load.

  The reason this works is because we set the rout
  file to <span>match
  ":controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))", via =>
  :get</span>. This is saying to look for whatever
  controller name is given and if found look for what
  ever action is given. However, we don't have an
  action for hello currently defined. Using the route
  we set-up, rails knows to look for the template for
  hello.html.erb from the views folder, and since we
  had one there, it was displayed back to the
  browser. If our routes file only contained
  <span>get "demo/index"</span> would only pull up
  the index.html.erb page becuse this method will
  only work if the exact strings match.

  If we type in
  <span>localhost:3000/demo/money</span> then it will
  return an error called <span>Unknown action</span>.
  The framework is saying there is no action method
  in the demo controlled called "money" and there is
  also no template called "money.html.erb" in the
  rails views folder, and thus we get an error
  message.

  We have shown we can render a page without the use
  of an action, but it's considered a best practice
  to set up an action method for this, so your demo
  controller file should contain the following bit of
  code.
</p>
  <pre class="code">
    def hello
    end
  </pre>
  <p>
  Now let's have a bit of fun. We can make the index
  action render the hello.html.erb template using the
  code below in our demo controller file. Also, let's
  go ahead and make the hello action render the
  index.html.erb template as well. We don't have to provide the <span>.html.erb extension because that's not part of the name of the template.</span>
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    def index
      render(:template => 'demo/hello')
    end

    or

    def index
      render("demo/hello")
    end
  </pre>
  <p>
    If you visit the index and hello page they will
    render as follows.
    <pre class="code">

<h1>Demo#Hello</h1>
This page represents the demo controller with
the hello view/action.
    </pre>
    <pre class="code">

<h1 style=>Demo#index</h1>
This page represents the demo controller and
the index view/action.
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you look at the server log you will see this.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <b>Started GET "/demo/hello"</b> for 127.0.0.1 at
    2017-10-11 22:44:49 -0400
    <b>Processing by DemoController#hello</b> as HTML
    <b>Rendered demo/index.html.erb within
    layouts/application (0.0ms)</b>
    Completed 200 OK in 34ms (Views: 34.4ms |
    ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
  </pre>
  <p>
    Three things happened here (in regards to going to
    <span>localhost:3000/demo/hello</span>).
    1. The server received a GET request to access "
    demo/hello".
    3. The demo controller processes the request by refering to the hello action method.
    2. The server rendered the template layout
    "demo/index.html.erb" within layouts/application
    which is what was displayed on our browser screen.
  </p>
